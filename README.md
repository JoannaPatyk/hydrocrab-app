# Hydrodrop ðŸ’§

**Hydrodrop** is a simple application that allows users to track the amount of water they drink throughout the day.

After starting the app, you will see the main window with glasses of water. In the future, the user will be able to click on individual glasses to record the amount of water drunk, which will fill up a large glass. This is a feature that I plan to add in the future.

To set the daily goal for the amount of water you want to drink, you can go to the settings page. The app will then display your progress towards that goal, allowing you to track how much water you have consumed throughout the day.

In the future, I also plan to add a feature that will allow you to view a history of the amount of water you drank on previous days. This will help you to monitor your overall water intake over time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
